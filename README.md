This [CiviCRM extension](https://civicrm.org) integrates WordPress with the CiviCRM mail editor replacement [Mosaico](https://civicrm.org/extensions/email-template-builder). The gallery now uses the WordPress media library.
It also contains an enhanced Versafix template with a new template block. This block comes with a
property editor that shows all available Wordpress posts. It applies the post title, excerpt with
adjustable length an a read more button with just one click. In addition, section margins can be applied
and href anchors can be set to allow an easy in-mail navigation via a TOC.
As a bonus, embedding images into HTML mails can be optionally set (Mailings->Wordpress - Mosaico integration settings). This feature generates larger emails, but images are immediately visible when viewing the mail, without having to allow remote images in the mail program.
